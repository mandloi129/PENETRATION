Why is Android so powerful?

Simple, everyone has a smartphone and spends all the time with it! We have the possibility to camouflage easily in the middle of everyone, the processor architecture of most Android smartphones is ARM a modern and robust architecture extremely superior to the rest, With touch screens we can run the tools with great agility and take advantage of the graphical interface of Android, we can get in almost anywhere with our smartphones...

If you do not understand how great it is you're not a Penetration Tester!

With Android we have a lot of power in our hands, we can do everything we do with a desktop and more.
